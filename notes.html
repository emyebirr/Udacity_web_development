        <h2> Tree structures</h2>
        <p>Tree structures are a way of organizing data hierarchically. Each item in a tree is called a node, and each node can have zero or more child nodes.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The top node in a tree is called the root.</li>
            <li>Nodes with no children are called leaves.</li>
            <li>Each node has a parent, except for the root node.</li>
        </ul>
